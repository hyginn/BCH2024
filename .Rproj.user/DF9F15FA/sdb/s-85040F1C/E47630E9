The sole purpose of init() is to\n# source() the file \".init.R\" at the time you are sitting at the console and\n# working. \".init.R\" in turn loads utility functions into the Workspace by\n# source()'ing \".utilities.R\", and then loads the file you are reading now,\n# which contains usage information and other notes. The actual contents of the\n# project is in the Project Files listed below. There may be additional files\n# either in the main working directory or in subfolders \"assets\" and/or \"data\" -\n# as the case may be. All files and folders are listed in the File Pane and you\n# can click on them to explore what else is here.\n#\n\n# == HOW TO WORK WITH THE FILES IN THIS PROJECT ================================\n\n# This project contains scripts and data for BCH2024 course/workshop. The\n# project assumes you have worked through the introductory R tutorial\n# (http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/R_tutorial), the\n# exercises in the \"R_Exercise-BasicSetup\" project, and all of the material in\n# the R_Exercise-Bioinformatics project. If you haven't done this yet, complete\n# it first.\n\n# === Study code in the Project Files, write code in \"myScript.R\"\n\n# In general you study and execute the code in the major Project Files, which\n# you do not modify (i.e. don't edit, save, and commit them). This way you can\n# update them from GitHub through R's version control interface if necessary.\n\n# However you should still copy, modify and otherwise experiment and play with\n# code, in order to build _active_ coding skills. I have provided a file\n# \"myScript.R\" for this purpose, but of course you can create any number of\n# scripts on your own (prefacing their names with the prefix \"my\" may be a good\n# idea). Save your code in \"myScript.R\", but don't _commit_ your changes to\n# version control. The reason is the same: once you _commit_ your changes, you\n# can no longer simply pull updated versions of the project from the GitHub\n# repository but will need to do more complicated things.\n\n\n# ==== In case of error messages when updating files\n#\n# This probably won't happen, but if you pull from GitHub and get the following\n# type of error ...\n#     ---------------\n#     error: Your local changes to the following files would be\n#     overwritten by merge\n#     ...\n#     Please commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.\n#     ---------------\n# ... then, you need to bring the offending file into its original state.\n# Open the Commit window, select the file, and click on the Revert button.\n#\n# Of course, you can save a local copy under a different name before you revert,\n# in case you want to keep your changes.\n\n\n# === Working with the Project Files\n\n# We will cover the Project Files in class, probably the sequence listed below.\n# While working with the Project Files, DO NOT SIMPLY  source()  THEM!\n\n# If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system, Google for an\n# answer, or ask me. Don't continue if you don't understand what's going on.\n# That's not how it works ...  Every single expression counts.\n\n# == PROJECT FILES =============================================================\n\n#    1: 01_Data.R\n#    2: 02_Features.R\n#    3: 03_Modelling.R\n#    4: 04_Graphs.R\n#    5: 05_Clustering.R\n#    6: 06_MachineLearning.R\n\n# [END]\n",
