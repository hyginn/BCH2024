# Write your notes and code experiments into this document. Save it
# from time to time - however I recommend that you do not _commit_ 
# your saved version.
#
# As long as you do not _commit_ this script to version control, 
# you can _pull_ updated versions of the entire project from GitHub
# by using the RStudio version control interface. However, once 
# you _commit_ any file in your local version, RStudio will require
# you to resolve conflicts before you can _pull_ updates.
